# Gold Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
## Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm. The XGBoost Regressor is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm that excels in regression tasks. By considering various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors, the model generates accurate predictions for house prices.
## Results
The XGBoost Regressor model achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting house prices. It provides valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices and can be used for real estate analysis and decision-making.
### Datasets used to train our model will be added Later.
