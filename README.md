# House Prediction using XGB Regressor
## Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm. The XGBoost Regressor is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm that excels in regression tasks. By considering various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors, the model generates accurate predictions for house prices.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab(Recommended)
- numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
